# Flat_Price_Prediction
the data contains the following features of a flat price, floor area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, latitude, longitude etc. with one final predicted value - price.  I am going to apply various regression machine learning models to the dataset to predict the price per square feet of housing flats in Singapore. In different models, I will use absolute percentage error difference of test data to assess their predictive accuracy.  To make the notebook entry easier to read, In this notebook, I will be covering 3 basic ML algorithms with some analysis on their parameters, followed by some feature selection and feature extraction methods:
